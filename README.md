Housing Demonstrator
====================

The focus of this project is to demonstrate the link between availability of developable land and space and affordable housing development. This requires a rigorous analysis of residential land development potential that is essentially linked to datasets such as land value and capital improved value information (Agunbiade et al 2011).

The core analysis is intended to determine Residential Development Potential Index (RDPI) for a cross section of the NW Corridor region. Spatially enabled tools provide this (Kalantari 2007). The tool aims to provide ways of analysing and communicating, the challenges and prospects of discovering developable land for housing production.
